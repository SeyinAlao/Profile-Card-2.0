            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a passionate Front-end developer with a keen interest in building accessible and user-friendly
          web applications. My journey into web development started with a fascination for how
          technology can solve real-world problems and create meaningful experiences for users.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in writing clean, semantic code that not only works well but also serves
          everyone, regardless of their abilities or the devices they use. Accessibility isn't
          just a checklist item for me. it's a core principle that guides every line of code I write.

            Remember when this journey felt challenging? You've come far since then.
            Stay humble, keep learning, and never lose your curiosity. The web keeps evolving

        <h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          This program has taught me that web development isn't just about code it's about curiosity and attention to detail.
          Every element, every label, and every color choice impacts someone's experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accessibility and semantic HTML aren't optional; they're fundamental to creating
          inclusive, professional web applications.
