# Profile Card 2.0 â€” Stage 1 ðŸš€

## Overview
This is the continuation of my Stage 0 task.  
In this stage, I added two new pages:
- **About Me Page** â€” with semantic HTML sections and reflections.  
- **Contact Page** â€” includes form validation using JavaScript.

## Features Added in Stage 1
- Responsive layout using Flexbox and media queries.
- Form validation (required fields, valid email, message â‰¥ 10 characters).
- Accessibility improvements (labels, aria-describedby).
- Semantic HTML (`main`, `section`, `ul`, `p`, `h2`).
- Added success/error messages for user feedback.
